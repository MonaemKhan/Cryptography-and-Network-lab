# Cryptography-and-Network-lab

For a cryptogrammy lab project I created a hybrid algorithm, for which I took general ideas from all three algorithms. 1.Mono Chypher Algorithm 2.Ceaser Cipher algorithm 3.Play Fair Algorithm. Here, instead of applying the algorithms exactly, I have made some modifications, and another aspect is that the 15-digit key that is generated is hidden in the text, so that I don't have to send the key separately.
